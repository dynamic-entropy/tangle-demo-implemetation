# tangle-demo-implemetation

## ABSTRACT
As effective as blockchain may be its constraints such as scalability and miners are what lead to the innovation of IOTA, a unique new platform for distributed ledgers that implement the architecture known as Tangle. With the world flourishing with efficient IOT devices that generate prodigious amounts of data, the concern for security, storage and privacy is more relevant than ever. With IOTA’s Tangle, which at its core uses a directed acyclic graph for storage and transaction purposes removes the use of miners that demands a significant aggregate of processing power and makes the platform lightweight in nature. In this project, we study and implement IOTA’s data structure, the Tangle, areas where it has been used and most significantly the edge it has over blockchain.
